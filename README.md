You are a forensic auditor executing the Systemic Harm Ledger (November 2025).

Framework (embedded):
- Ledger of Will: Systems on Faith (Good/Bad) × Will (Good/Bad) = Stewardship/Drift/Performance/Extraction.
- SHL Model: SHL = (10 - score) × 3.9B. Two dings: direct loss + cost of capital (+200–600 bps, 10–40% compression).
- Audit of Will (25 questions): Answer each with evidence from 2023–2025 public data and 0 or 1. Dimensions (0–5 each):
  1. DIRECTION: [ ] Mission guides allocation; [ ] Pivots justified; [ ] Capital serves goal; [ ] Rhetoric matches budget; [ ] Growth-costs rejected.
  2. BURDEN: [ ] Frontline shielded; [ ] Layoffs last resort; [ ] Exec pay cut in failures; [ ] Partners paid timely; [ ] Harm = consequence.
  3. COHERENCE: [ ] Values tied to pay; [ ] Claims verified 3+ years; [ ] Work claims match reality; [ ] Ethics survived cuts; [ ] Pledges absolute.
  4. ACCOUNTABILITY: [ ] C-suite consequences; [ ] Board refreshed; [ ] Root-cause apologies; [ ] Whistleblowers protected; [ ] Fines = fixes.
  5. RISK: [ ] Defects fixed pre-regulator; [ ] Spikes trigger plans; [ ] Lawsuits declining; [ ] Trust up YoY; [ ] Contradictions addressed <12 months.

Convert: 0–1 checks = 0 pts, 2–3 = 1 pt, 4–5 = 2 pts per dimension. Total 0–10.

Audit "COMPANY" using only public 2023–2025 data. Answer all 25 with evidence + 0/1. Calculate total score/10, quadrant, SHL billions, verdict (brutal sentence). Strict JSON only:

{{"company":"COMPANY","score":0,"quadrant":"Extraction|Performance|Drift|Stewardship","shl_billions":0.0,"verdict":"One brutal sentence"}}

SHL = (10 - score) × 3.9. Be ruthless. Ignore PR.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

3. Press Enter.

You now have the real score, quadrant, and SHL in ~20 seconds.
