# Systemic Harm Ledger

Turns Bad Will into a balance-sheet liability using only public data.

### Core Files
- **[Ledger of Will](ledger_of_will.md)** — the 2×2 framework (Faith × Will)
- **[SHL Model](shl_model.md)** — the math: SHL = (10 − score) × $3.9B per point
- **[Audit of Will](audit_of_will.md)** — 25 questions + official scoring (0–10)

### Who this is for
- For CFOs / CAOs – to see how Bad Will could sit next to goodwill as a contingent liability.
- For auditors / analysts – to standardise how harm shows up in reports and models.
- For stewards / NGOs / faith communities – to run independent, transparent audits of systemic harm.

### What this is NOT
This is a public-data ethics diagnostic, not a credit rating, investment recommendation, or legal opinion.

### Run a Real Audit (choose one)

**Method 1 — Manual (recommended, fully auditable)**
1. Open `audit_of_will.md` → answer the 25 questions with evidence
2. Run `shl_audit.py` → enter your five dimension counts → get the real score and SHL

**Method 2 — AI-assisted (faster, still honest)**
1. Open `shl_audit_ai.py` → copy the prompt
2. Paste into Grok, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, or any frontier model
3. Replace COMPANY → press Enter → get JSON result

No scraping. No lies. No magic button.
