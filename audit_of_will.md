# The Audit Of Will | Living Intentionally For Evolving L.I.F.E.

# The Audit Of Will

The Audit of Will is a diagnostic lens that reveals how organizations create trust or harm through their daily decisions, incentives, and structures.

It is not a culture survey.  
It is not an engagement score.  
It is a structural pattern-recognition tool built for leaders, investors, regulators, and citizens who want to see systems clearly.

### INTRODUCTION — THE LENS THAT REVEALS

Five dimensions.  
Twenty-five observable questions.  
One score out of 25.

Can be run quarterly or annually using only public data — no internal cooperation required.

### THE FIVE DIMENSIONS

1. DIRECTION  
   Do repeated decisions over years reinforce or quietly erode the stated purpose?

2. BURDEN  
   Who actually carries the weight of the system’s choices and volatility?

3. COHERENCE  
   Do actions, incentives, and outcomes match the public claims?

4. ACCOUNTABILITY  
   Does authority carry the consequences it creates, or is blame displaced?

5. RISK  
   What visible drift patterns (injuries, turnover, lawsuits, contradictions) remain unaddressed quarter after quarter?

Each dimension is scored 0–5  
(5 = strong coherence and stewardship, 0 = extraction and bad faith)

Total score determines quadrant position on the Ledger of Will.

### QUADRANT MAPPING

≥ 20 → Quadrant I   Stewardship  
14–19 → Quadrant II  Unexamined Drift  
9–13 → Quadrant III Performance  
≤ 8  → Quadrant IV  Extraction

### HOW TO RUN THE AUDIT

Anyone can execute the full 25-question audit using only public sources:

- SEC filings & earnings-call transcripts  
- OSHA / labor-board citations  
- Court dockets & whistleblower disclosures  
- Glassdoor / Blind / TeamBlind sentiment  
- Regulatory investigations (NHTSA, FTC, DOJ, EU, etc.)  
- Employee turnover & injury statistics  
- Customer complaint trends  
- News archives

No internal access needed.

### WHY THE AUDIT WORKS

It measures structural reality, not declared intention.  
Contradictions become impossible to hide.  
Deflection patterns become visible.  
Drift can no longer hide behind narrative, growth, or PR.

Leaders who run it privately regain clarity.  
Those who ignore it eventually face it publicly — through regulators, talent flight, customers, or markets.
