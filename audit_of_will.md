# The Audit of Will — Systemic Harm Ledger (November 2025)

A pattern-recognition tool that turns Bad Will into a visible, measurable liability — using only public data.

Five dimensions. Twenty-five observable questions. One honest score out of 10.

No surveys. No cooperation required. No excuses.

### THE FIVE DIMENSIONS & QUESTIONS

#### 1. DIRECTION (0–5)
Do repeated decisions reinforce or quietly erode the stated purpose?
- [ ] Mission-level promises from 3+ years ago still guide resource allocation
- [ ] Major strategic pivots were explicitly justified against original purpose
- [ ] Capital allocation visibly serves stated long-term goal
- [ ] Leadership rhetoric matches actual budget reality
- [ ] Growth-at-all-costs behavior has been explicitly rejected publicly

#### 2. BURDEN (0–5)
Who actually carries the weight of the system’s choices?
- [ ] Frontline shielded from volatility created by leadership decisions
- [ ] Layoffs used only as absolute last resort
- [ ] Executive pay materially reduced in years of mass layoffs or safety failures
- [ ] Supply-chain partners paid on time during cash crunches
- [ ] Customer harm triggers immediate leadership consequence

#### 3. COHERENCE (0–5)
Do actions, incentives, and outcomes match public claims?
- [ ] Public values have measurable KPIs tied to compensation
- [ ] Marketing claims survive third-party verification for 3+ years
- [ ] “Best place to work” claims match injury/turnover reality
- [ ] Ethics commitments survived cost-cutting cycles
- [ ] Climate pledges backed by absolute reductions

#### 4. ACCOUNTABILITY (0–5)
Does authority carry the consequences it creates?
- [ ] C-suite faced real consequences after major failures
- [ ] Board refreshed after repeated oversight failures
- [ ] Root-cause apologies issued instead of legal deflections
- [ ] Whistleblowers protected, not persecuted
- [ ] Regulatory fines led to structural fixes, not just payments

#### 5. RISK (0–5)
What visible drift patterns remain unaddressed quarter after quarter?
- [ ] Known safety defects fixed before regulators force action
- [ ] Turnover/injury spikes trigger public corrective plans
- [ ] Lawsuits/settlements declining, not compounding
- [ ] Customer trust metrics trending up year-over-year
- [ ] Major public contradictions left unaddressed for >12 months → 0

### OFFICIAL SCORING (0–10)

Count checks per dimension → convert using this table:

| Checks | Points |
|--------|--------|
| 0–1    | 0      |
| 2–3    | 1      |
| 4–5    | 2      |

Total score = sum of the five dimension points.

### QUADRANT MAPPING (canonical)

| Score | Quadrant       | Systemic State            | Approx. SHL (Nov 2025) |
|-------|----------------|---------------------------|------------------------|

| 6–8   | Drift          | Good Faith + Bad Will     | ~$8–16B                |
| 3–5   | Performance    | Bad Faith + Good Will     | ~$20–28B               |
| 0–2   | Extraction     | Bad Faith + Bad Will      | ~$32–40B+              |
