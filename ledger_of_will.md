# The Ledger of Will | L.I.F.E.

A generative diagnostic from the crossroads of **Will** (impact) and **Faith** (intention), built to help leaders and institutions see the *true direction* of their systems.

## The Core Idea

Every system moves in two dimensions:

- **Will** — what the system *produces* in the world.  
- **Faith** — what the system *intends* and is oriented toward.

Most organizations measure one and ignore the other.  
But **only when intention and impact are seen together can the real state of a system be known**.

## The Cross of Will & Faith

Plotting these axes reveals four structural states:

1. **Good Faith + Good Will** → *Stewardship*  
2. **Good Faith + Bad Will** → *Unexamined Drift*  
3. **Bad Faith + Good Will** → *Performance (Inherited Trust)*  
4. **Bad Faith + Bad Will** → *Extraction*

These are not moral judgments — they are **architectural realities** that show whether a system is aligned, drifting, masking misalignment, or eroding.

## Why It Matters

Seeing both Will and Faith clarifies:

- where trust is earned or consumed  
- where contradiction hides  
- where systems drift before they collapse  
- how to realign toward stewardship rather than extraction

This framework offers leaders a way to **see systems whole** — beyond narrative, performance, or aspiration.
