# NOTE:
# This file is not executable business logic.
# It contains a prompt template used to run the Systemic Harm Ledger (SHL)
# “Audit of Will” with an AI model.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Open any frontier AI model (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.0, etc.).
#   2. Paste the printed prompt into the model.
#   3. Replace COMPANY with the actual company name.
#   4. Let the model browse public 2023–2025 data and return a single JSON
#      object with the final SHL score, quadrant, SHL billions, and verdict.
#
# The reasoning over all 25 questions happens inside the model; the response
# itself must be strictly valid JSON so it can be parsed by other tools.
