TASK:
   - Produce 25 numbered items (1–25).
   - For each item, provide ONLY:
   - "score": 0 or 1
   - "evidence": one factual sentence with a public source DO NOT include the question text itself.
   - After all 25 items, compute dimension totals (0–5 each).
   - Convert each dimension total to SHL points: 0–1 checks → 0 pts 2–3 checks → 1 pt 4–5 checks → 2 pts
   - Sum to produce the final 0–10 score.
   - Compute SHL = (10 – score) × 3.9
- Output ONE final JSON block at the end only, in this exact structure:
{ "company": "verano", "score": 0, "quadrant": "Stewardship|Drift|Performance|Extraction", "shl_billions": 0.0, "verdict": "One brutal sentence" }
