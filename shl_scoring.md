Scoring the Audit
The Audit of Will is designed to be simple, observable, and repeatable.
Each dimension already includes five checkmarks. 
Scoring transforms those checkmarks into a clear picture of the system’s state.

✔️ How Scoring Works
For each of the five dimensions (Direction, Burden, Coherence, Accountability, Risk), count how many boxes are checked:

0–1 checks → 0 points
2–3 checks → 1 point
4–5 checks → 2 points
This yields a dimension score between 0 and 2.

📊 Total Audit Score
Add the five dimension scores together:

Total Score: 0 to 10 points

📉 Interpreting the Score
The total score aligns directly with the four systemic states described in the Ledger of Will:

0–2	Extraction — Bad Faith + Bad Will
3–5	Performance — Bad Faith + Good Will
6–8	Drift — Good Faith + Bad Will
9–10	Stewardship — Good Faith + Good Will
This rubric keeps the audit intuitive and grounded.
No complex formulas. No weighting.
Just patterns that reveal where the system stands, how it moves, and where alignment can be restored.
