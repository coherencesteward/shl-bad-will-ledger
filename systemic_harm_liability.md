# The Systemic Harm Liability (SHL) Model — November 2025

The mathematical companion to the Ledger of Will.  
Turns Bad Will into a balance-sheet liability using only public data.

### CORE INSIGHT
A company operating in Extraction or Performance carries an unrecognized contingent liability equal to the expected future cost of the structural harm it continues to create.

This liability hits in two permanent ways (“the two dings”):

1. Direct expected cash outflows (fines, lawsuits, talent flight, customer loss, etc.)  
2. Permanent increase in cost of capital (higher risk premium demanded by every stakeholder)

Both are real. Both compound until resolved.

### CURRENT SHL FORMULA (calibrated Nov 2025, S&P 500 median)

**SHL ≈ (10 − Audit-of-Will score) × $3.9 billion per point lost**

| Audit score | Quadrant      | Approx. SHL range       | Example (29 Nov 2025)        |
|-------------|---------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| 9–10        | Stewardship   | ~$0–4B                   | Patagonia 10/10 → ~$0B       |
| 6–8         | Drift         | ~$8–16B                  | Microsoft 6/10 → ~$15.6B     |
| 3–5         | Performance   | ~$20–28B                 | Apple 5/10 → ~$19.5B         |
| 0–2         | Extraction    | ~$31–40B+                | Tesla 1/10 → ~$35.1B         |
|             |               |                          | Amazon 1/10 → ~$35.1B        |

### Definition: The 3.9B Systemic Harm Multiplier

The **3.9B multiplier** is a normalization constant that converts each point of lost stewardship into an estimated \$3.9 billion in systemic harm. It provides a consistent, cross-firm proxy for annual value extraction and unpriced externalities.

#### Why 3.9B? (Calibration Logic)
The multiplier is calibrated so that a firm scoring **0/10** on stewardship yields an SHL of roughly **\$39B**. This value approximates:

- The median S&P 500 / Fortune 500 annual revenue (~\$20B)
- Doubled to reflect unpriced externalities such as environmental damage, regulatory fines, and inequality amplification

The value aligns with global economic research estimating unpriced harms at **5–10% of GDP**, but it is intentionally stylized to preserve comparability across firms rather than function as a precise econometric estimate.

#### Interpretation
Every 1 point lost in the Audit-of-Will corresponds to approximately **\$3.9B** in expected systemic harm.  
SHL represents **probable value destruction**, not total collapse or existential failure.  
Human and social costs are **not** included; this remains a financial-only proxy.

#### Why It Is Conservative
The 3.9B multiplier intentionally understates total harm because it:

- Uses observed value-destruction events (e.g., Boeing, Wells Fargo, Meta, Tesla, Volkswagen) as its empirical floor
- Excludes non-financial human impacts
- Assumes partial correction rather than catastrophic failure

### THE TWO PERMANENT “DINGS”

1. **First ding** — Direct expected loss  
   Present value of future cash outflows caused by sustained misalignment.

2. **Second ding** — Higher cost of capital  
   Stakeholders permanently demand:
   - +200–600 bps equity risk premium
   - Wider debt spreads
   - 10–40 % valuation multiple compression

### RECOGNITION TRIGGERS (when SHL must be treated as real)
- Audit-of-Will score ≤ 5/10 for 3+ consecutive years
- Active regulatory probe with >$5B potential liability
- Sustained labor or customer revolt
- Validated whistleblower disclosures

Companies that refuse to recognize SHL simply delay the inevitable — and make the eventual correction larger.
