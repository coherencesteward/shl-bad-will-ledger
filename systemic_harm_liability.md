# The Systemic Harm Liability (SHL) Model — November 2025

The mathematical companion to the Ledger of Will.  
Turns Bad Will into a balance-sheet liability using only public data.

### CORE INSIGHT
A company operating in Extraction or Performance carries an unrecognized contingent liability equal to the expected future cost of the structural harm it continues to create.

This liability hits in two permanent ways (“the two dings”):

1. Direct expected cash outflows (fines, lawsuits, talent flight, customer loss, etc.)  
2. Permanent increase in cost of capital (higher risk premium demanded by every stakeholder)

Both are real. Both compound until resolved.

### CURRENT SHL FORMULA (calibrated Nov 2025, S&P 500 median)

**SHL ≈ (10 − Audit-of-Will score) × $3.9 billion per point lost**

| Audit score | Quadrant      | Approx. SHL range       | Example (29 Nov 2025)        |
|-------------|---------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| 9–10        | Stewardship   | ~$0–4B                   | Patagonia 10/10 → ~$0B       |
| 6–8         | Drift         | ~$8–16B                  | Microsoft 6/10 → ~$15.6B     |
| 3–5         | Performance   | ~$20–28B                 | Apple 5/10 → ~$19.5B         |
| 0–2         | Extraction    | ~$31–40B+                | Tesla 1/10 → ~$35.1B         |
|             |               |                          | Amazon 1/10 → ~$35.1B        |

The $3.9B multiplier is deliberately conservative:
- Based on observed valuation destruction in Boeing, Meta, Tesla, Wells Fargo, Volkswagen, etc.
- Excludes non-financial human cost
- Assumes partial correction, not total collapse

### THE TWO PERMANENT “DINGS”

1. **First ding** — Direct expected loss  
   Present value of future cash outflows caused by sustained misalignment.

2. **Second ding** — Higher cost of capital  
   Stakeholders permanently demand:
   - +200–600 bps equity risk premium
   - Wider debt spreads
   - 10–40 % valuation multiple compression

### RECOGNITION TRIGGERS (when SHL must be treated as real)
- Audit-of-Will score ≤ 5/10 for 3+ consecutive years
- Active regulatory probe with >$5B potential liability
- Sustained labor or customer revolt
- Validated whistleblower disclosures

Companies that refuse to recognize SHL simply delay the inevitable — and make the eventual correction larger.
